<h2>The Proposal</h2>

<p>Coming up with a unique proposal idea was pretty tough at first. After weeks of dead ends I finally came up with something that I thought would be a lot of fun and I called up my sister, Adriana to see if he'd be willing to help me shoot and edit a short film for Amanda. Of course he said yes without hesitating (thanks again little sis).</p>

<p>I knew Amanda wanted the proposal to be a big celebration with lots of friends and family around, so on a Friday night in May of 2014 we went to a beautiful park to take a walk in Germany. As the video played dozens of friends and family that I had called prior to the proposal popped up out of hiding places around the giant wall, surprising Courtney as the video played. At the end of the video, with dozens of people watching, I dropped down on one knee and I asked the girl of my dreams to marry me. She said yes.</p>
